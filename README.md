## Installation

To set up and build the project, you only need to ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11:** If you don't have JDK 11 installed, download and install it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

2. **Apache Maven:** Maven handles the project's dependencies and builds. If you don't have Maven installed, download and install it from [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
3. Once you have JDK 11 and Maven installed, you're ready to go. Maven will automatically download all the project dependencies specified in the `pom.xml` file and build the project when you run the appropriate Maven commands.
